Financial News Sentiment Analysis

ðŸ“Œ Objective

This project aims to analyze the sentiment of financial news headlines (positive, negative, or neutral) using machine learning techniques. It provides insights into market sentiment to assist investors and analysts in decision-making.

Data source
use a publicly available dataset  such as:
kaggle data set:Financial phrase bank
yahoo  finance news scraper
bloomberg api

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Data Import and Cleaning: Preprocessed financial news data to remove noise.

Data Visualization: Explored the distribution of sentiments and visualized frequently occurring words.

Feature Extraction: Used TF-IDF vectorization to transform text data into numerical features.

Modeling: Built a classification model using Naive Bayes for sentiment prediction.

Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and a confusion matrix.

Prediction: Made predictions on new financial news headlines.
